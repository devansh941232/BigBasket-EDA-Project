## 📌 Project Overview :-

Big Basket is one of India's leading online grocery stores, offering a vast array of products across categories. Through this analysis, I explore how sales, product ratings, and discounts vary by category, and identify opportunities for business growth and customer engagement. Using Python, I analyzed over 27,000 products to extract insights into which products, brands, and categories perform best, and where there’s room for improvement.
